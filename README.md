# TD(γ)

Empirical Study of **TD(γ)** Reinforcement Learning algorithm for Value
function Estimation.

The studied algorithm was introduced in [TDγ: Re-evaluating Complex Backups in
Temporal Difference
Learning](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4472-td_gamma-re-evaluating-complex-backups-in-temporal-difference-learning.pdf)
paper by G. Konidaris, S. Niekum and P. Thomas which was presented at NIPS
2011.

Obtained results show that **TD(γ)** was able to outperform its precursors
given a fairly simple environment and policy, but was much more
resource-intensive in terms of memory and computational complexity.
